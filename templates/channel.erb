[Channel]
	# Pre-defined channels can be configured in [Channel] sections.
	# Such channels are created by the server when starting up and even
	# persist when there are no more members left.
	# Persistent channels are marked with the mode 'P', which can be set
	# and unset by IRC operators like other modes on the fly.
	# There may be more than one [Channel] block, one for each channel.
